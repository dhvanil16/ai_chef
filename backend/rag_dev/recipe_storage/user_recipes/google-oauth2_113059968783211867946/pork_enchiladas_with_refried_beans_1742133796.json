  "cooking_tips": [
    "If you prefer spicier enchiladas, use a hot enchilada sauce or add a pinch of chili powder to the meat mixture.",
    "For a richer flavor, you can substitute the refried beans with homemade refried beans.",
    "Warm the tortillas in a dry skillet or microwave before filling to prevent them from cracking.",
    "If you don't have taco seasoning on hand, you can make your own using the recipe provided in the context.",
    "Don't overfill the tortillas, or they may be difficult to roll and may burst open during baking."
