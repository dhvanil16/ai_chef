  "recipe_name": "Mexican Street Corn (Elote)",
  "ingredients": [
    "4 cobs corn",
    "4 tbsp mayonnaise",
    "\u00bd cup cotija, queso blanco, feta, Romano or Parmesan cheese, grated",
    "Chili powder (ancho or cayenne recommended)",
    "1 lime, sliced into wedges"
  ],
  "instructions": [
    "Turn your oven's broiler to high.",
    "Peel off the outer layers of the corn and clean off all the corn silk. Leave the green ends attached for a convenient handhold.",
    "Place the cobs on a baking pan under the broiler for 2 to 3 minutes, then rotate them and repeat until they're brown and toasty all the way around. The broiling shouldn't take more than 10 minutes total.",
    "Working quickly, spread a tablespoon of mayonnaise over each cob, lightly coating every kernel.",
    "Sprinkle the cheese all over the corn. It should stick fairly easily to the mayonnaise.",
    "Sprinkle chili powder over the corn (not too much).",
    "Squeeze lime juice all over and serve hot!"
  ],
  "cooking_tips": [
    "If you have an outdoor grill, prepare the corn that way.",
    "For those without a grill, a broiler is a great shortcut.",
    "Don't use too much chili powder, or it'll be gritty."
