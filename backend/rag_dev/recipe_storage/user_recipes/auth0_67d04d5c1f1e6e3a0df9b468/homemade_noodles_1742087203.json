    "For crispier noodles, fry some thinly sliced dried noodles in hot oil until brown and sprinkle them on top of the boiled noodles.",
    "Boiled noodles can be served with various sauces like brown sauce, tomato sauce, or a garlic and tomato sauce.",
    "The thinner the noodles are rolled, the faster they will cook.",
    "Be careful not to roll the dough so thin that it tears."
